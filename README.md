# BelongsTo field with dependency support for Nova

This package is an extension of Laravel Nova's existing BelongsTo field and Vue components.

Originally created by manmohanjit, the original package was abandoned. The followed by webparking but I corrected some issues and addedd support for searchable fields.

## Installation

You can install this package on a Laravel app that uses [Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) via composer:

```bash
composer require scops/nova-belongs-to-dependency
```

## Usage

The following will list categories with `type_id` equal to the value set in the first BelongsTo field.

```php
use Webparking\BelongsToDependency\BelongsToDependency;
...
return [
    ...
    BelongsTo::make('Type'),
    
    BelongsToDependency::make('User')
        ->dependsOn('type', 'type_id'),
    ...
];
```

Look at the [example](#example) below for other use cases.

## Example

Database Structure

- Type (id, name)
- Posts (id, type_id, category_id, title, body)
- Category (id, type_id, title)

We should only be able to assign categories to posts that belong to the same type.

This is how you would achieve it on the Nova category resource:

```php
use Webparking\BelongsToDependency\BelongsToDependency;
...
return [
    ...
    BelongsTo::make('Type'),
    
    BelongsToDependency::make('User')
        ->dependsOn('type', 'type_id'),
    ...
];
```

This would work if you used a text/enum `type` field too.

```php
use Webparking\BelongsToDependency\BelongsToDependency;
...
return [
    ...
    Select::make('Type')->options([
        'post' => 'Post',
        'page' => 'Page',
    ])>displayUsingLabels(),
    
    BelongsToDependency::make('User')
        ->dependsOn('type', 'type'),
    ...
];
```
